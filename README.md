# Salary_Prediction_App-Streamlit
Web-App for Experience vs Salary ML model. We will have 3 pages/sections in our app
1) The home page where we will allow the user to explore the dataset and also visualize it
2) The prediction page where we would predict the salary based on the number of years of experience.
3) The Contribute page where we would ask the user to contribute data to our dataset!
